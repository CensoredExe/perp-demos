# Perpheads auto demo remover
Perpheads demo remover
This program will run every time in you turn on your PC in the background, check all your demos, and delete those after a certain amount of time
# How to use
For single use, you can just run the demo-remover.py file, however, if you spend too much time on Perp, I recommend setting it up for automatic use.
To use it automatically, follow these steps;
- Run setup.py
- Make a shortcut of the run_demos.bat file thats been created by right clicking it.
- Right click and cut the shortcut
- Click start, type run and hit enter
- Type shell:startup and hit enter
- Paste the shortcut in the folder thats been opened

Done!

If your python has been downloaded in something other than
C:\Users\user\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37-32\\python.exe
Please edit the run_demos.bat file by right clicking it, and changing the directory in the first speach marks, to your python.exe directory.
